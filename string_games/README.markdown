# String Games

Let's experiment with some small string puzzles.

## Challenges

Complete one or more of the following challenges as your time
allows. You may work on them in any order you choose.

### Palindrome-Ness

Write code to determine if a given string of characters is
or is not a palindrome.

* Level 1: Use whatever tools are helpful
* Level 2: Don't use `.reverse`
* Level 3: Don't use `.reverse` or any form of Array

### Sentence Reversal

Compute the reversal of a sentence. For example, `"This is a sample sentence"`
becomes "sentence sample a is This".

* Level 1: Use whatever tools are helpful
* Level 2: Don't use any form of Array
* Level 3: Use only strings, conditionals, and `each_char`
* Level 4: Manipulate the string in place rather than creating a new one

### Run Length Encoding/Decoding

Run length encoding is a compression technique that allows us
to represent strings with repeated characters in fewer total characters.

For instance, examine the following examples:

* `aaaabbbbbcccccc` becomes `4a5b6c`
* `abcccaaa` becomes `ab3c3a`

Implement functionality to both encode normal strings using
run-length and decode the results.

* Level 1: Use whatever tools are helpful
* Level 2: Can you do the encoding/decoding *without creating any new string objects*?

## Protocols

Use the following protocols for your pairing sessions:
### A. Fundamentals

Get familiar with the project and use any and all tools/techniques you're comfortable with.

### B. Short Methods/Functions

Good programming tends to use short methods. Let's push that idea to an extreme.

In this session, **write no methods or functions longer than 3 lines**.

That's just counting the body of the method. Don't exceed 80 characters in line
length -- that's missing the point.


### C. Your Editor is Important

Work on being more efficient, **code without using the mouse**.



### D. Enjoy the Silence

Think you've got the hang of this problem? Pairing going well? Let's see how
well you can communicate through code.

In this session, **don't speak**.
